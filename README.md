# Admin UI Starter

This repository contains a minimal React project configured with Vite and SCSS. It serves as a starting point for building an admin-style interface without relying on any CSS framework.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally

SCSS is configured globally via `src/index.scss` and imported automatically by Vite.
